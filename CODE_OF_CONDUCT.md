# ⚖️ Code of Conduct: SpectraGraph

## 1. Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the **SpectraGraph** project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## 2. Ethical OSINT Standards
As an Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tool, SpectraGraph carries a significant responsibility. All contributors must adhere to the following project-specific ethical principles:

* **Privacy First:** Contributions must not encourage or facilitate illegal doxxing or the exposure of non-public personal information (PII).
* **Investigative Neutrality:** Tools and transforms should be built for objective data analysis. We do not support features designed for targeted harassment or mass surveillance.
* **Transparency:** All data enrichment logic (Transforms) must be transparent, repeatable, and defensible. No "black box" logic.
* **Legal Compliance:** Contributions must respect the Terms of Service (ToS) of the external APIs used (e.g., Shodan, VirusTotal, GitHub).

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
