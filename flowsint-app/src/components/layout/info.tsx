                <li>
                  <strong>Connects scattered data</strong> — emails, domains, social accounts, IPs,
                  phone numbers, addresses, and more — into a single{' '}
                  <strong>investigative graph</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Offers <strong>visual transforms</strong> to pivot from one entity to related
